# HCI Final Project

## HOW TO RUN

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the project:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/CSPC-BSCS-3B/hciv2.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd hciv2
     ```

2. **Open the Project Folder**
   - Use Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor to open the `hciv2` folder.

3. **Install a Live Server Extension (Recommended)**
   - For best results, use a live server extension (such as the VS Code Live Server extension) to serve the files locally.
   - Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
     - Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
       - For Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 5500`
       - For Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500`
   - This will serve the project at `http://localhost:5500`.

4. **Open in Browser**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5500`.
   - You can now navigate to `index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, or any other page.

5. **Usage**
   - Interact with the UI, test the navigation, and use the features such as login, register, dark mode, and dropdown menus.

**Note:**
- No backend/server is required; this project is fully static and runs in the browser.
- For best experience, use the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
